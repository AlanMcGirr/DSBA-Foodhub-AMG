# FoodHub EDA Project – Data Science Capstone 1

## Project Overview
This project explores real-world data from **FoodHub**, an online food aggregator platform. The objective was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover business insights around customer behavior, delivery trends, and cuisine preferences.

---

## Key Questions Explored
- What are the most popular cuisines and restaurants?
- What percentage of orders cost more than $20?
- What is the mean delivery time overall? Does it differ by day of the week?
- Do higher food preparation times lead to lower customer ratings?

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Data Cleaning & Imputation
- Statistical Summary & Visual Analysis

---

## Key Insights
- **29% of orders** cost more than $20, with most clustered under that range.
- **Weekend deliveries** are ~6 minutes faster on average than weekdays.
- Ratings were originally missing for ~39% of orders and were imputed using restaurant-level averages for greater accuracy.
- Cuisine preferences show a strong skew toward **American, Japanese, and Italian** food.

---

## Results
- Scored **59/60** on submission, with positive feedback for structure, clarity, and insights.
- Developed strong working knowledge of real-world data cleaning, EDA techniques, and visualization storytelling.
